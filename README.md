# Examples
This repository acts as a portfolio of sample code, with a brief overview of the different files given below.

## Lilypad Generator
This MEL ([Maya](https://www.autodesk.co.uk/products/maya/overview) Embedded Language) script was written as part of an assignment in order to aid in the generation and random placement of background elements for a short animation. It allows for the dynamic generation and adjustment of lilypad "clusters", with the aim of integrating into a customary 3D modelling workflow.

## Snowflaker
This C++ program allows the user to quickly generate randomised snowflakes using a naive DLA (diffusion-limited aggregation) model of crystal formation, and export point data in .geo form for use in SideFX Houdini. The program uses an OpenGL graphics library developed at the NCCA, called NGL, which must be installed in order to build it. The snowflake.cpp code and corresponding header file include most of the relevant portions of algorithm code.

## Stedman
This is a one-file program built to aid in [composition](https://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/leary.pdf) for [change-ringing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_ringing). In essence, the program builds and then performs a breadth-first search on a very complicated directed graph, in order to find the shortest path between two specified permutations of n bells. There is basic functionality for saving results in a text file to disk in order to speed up subsequent searches.

## Pipes
This program was built when compiling my submission for a place at the National Centre for Computer Animation in Bournemouth. It is a simple OpenGL recreation of the classic  "Pipes" screensaver shipped with many Windows PCs running XP or earlier.

The following video demonstrates a simple robustness test for the program (TW: flashing imagery).

## Artwork
In addition to programming and creative writing, I have a long standing interest in illustration and animation, which informs my approach to workflow and tool design.
