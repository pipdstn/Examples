# Examples
This repository acts as a portfolio of sample code, with a brief overview of the different files given below.

## Stedman
This is a one-file program built to aid in [composition](https://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/leary.pdf) for [change-ringing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_ringing). In essence, the program builds and then performs a breadth-first search on a very complicated directed graph, in order to find the shortest path between two specified permutations of n bells. There is basic functionality for saving results in a text file to disk in order to speed up subsequent searches.

## Pipes
This program was built when compiling my submission for a place at the National Centre for Computer Animation in Bournemouth. It is a simple OpenGL recreation of the classic  "Pipes" screensaver shipped with many Windows PCs running XP or earlier.
